Stud’s mission is to pair students and select companies to enable qualitative meetings that provide the opportunity for personal contact. During the academic year of 2016-2017 the project group will attend events arranged together with the companies. Each event is tailored to meet each individual company’s needs, usually the project group is invited to spend an evening at the respective company’s office, where the students can gain deeper insight into life at the company and its operations.
